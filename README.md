## 🔧 Current Projects

### [OX\_Inventory Reimagined](https://github.com/TenTypeeek/ox_inventory_reimagined)

A modern rework of the original ox_inventory with better structure, metadata usage, and fully modular systems.

> Rebuilt for flexibility and realism. Inventory should feel like part of the world, not just a UI.
